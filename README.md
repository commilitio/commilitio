ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Aleksander, a veterinarian turned into Java enthusiast on a journey of continuous learning and growth.

ðŸŽ“ With a background in veterinary medicine, my passion for problem-solving led me to dive into the world of Java programming over a year ago. Despite occasional breaks, my commitment to mastering Java remains unwavering.

ðŸ’» Self-taught through online courses, training sessions, videos, and books, I embrace challenges as opportunities to learn. When I encounter a roadblock, you'll find me seeking guidance from course instructors, exploring online communities like Stack Overflow and 4Programmers, or even chatting with ChatGPT for fresh perspectives (handle with care!).
